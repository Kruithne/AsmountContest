== LargeChatFrame ==

This project is open-source and maintained on GitHub here: https://github.com/Kruithne/LargeChatFrame

This add-on provides quality-of-life perks to those who want to say a lot in-chat; mostly aimed at roleplayers. The default behavior of the Blizzard chat is not touched, a button is added to the chat frame to bring up the LargeChatFrame input window.
